 <h1>introduction</h1>
 <p>Cryptology consists of two branches:<br/>
      Cryptography is the area of constructing systems.<br/>
         Cryptanalysis is the area of breaking cryptographic systems.<br/>
        Cryptography is a field of computer science and mathematics that focusses on techniques for secure communication between two parties (Alice & Bob)
       while a third-party is present<br/>
       This is based on methods like encryption, decryption, signing, generating of pseudo random numbers, etc<br/>

	  The four ground principles of cryptography are Confidentiality Defines a set of rules that limitsaccess or adds restriction on certain information.<br/>
       Data Integrity Takes: care of the consistency and accuracy of data during its entire life-cycle.<br/>
       Authentication: Confirms the truth of an attribute of a datum that is claimed to be true by some entity.<br/>
     Non-Repudiation: Ensures the inability of an author of a statement resp. a piece of information to deny it.<br/>
      Nowadays there are in general two different schemes: On the one hand, there are symmetricschemes,
	  where both, Alice and Bob, need to have the same key in order to encrypt their communication.
     For this, they have to securely exchange the key initially. On the other hand, since Diffie and Hellmanâ€™s key exchange idea from 1976 there also exists the concept of asymmetric schemes where Alice and Bob both have a private and a public
       key. The public key can be shared with anyone, so Bob can use it to encrypt a message for Alice.
         But only Alice, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt the encrypted message from Bob.
       In this lecture we will discover several well-known cryptographic structures like RSA (Rivest-
       Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem), DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced Encryption
              Standard), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and many more. All these structures have two
         main aspects:<br/>
1. There is the security of the structure itself, based on mathematics. There is a standardization
process for cryptosystems based on theoretical research in mathematics and complexity
theory. Here our focus will lay in this lecture.<br/>
2. Then we have the implementation of the structures in devices, e.g. SSL, TLS in your web
browser or GPG for signed resp. encrypted emails. These implementations should not diverge
from the theoretical standards, but must still be very fast and convenient for the user.<br/>
It is often this mismatch between these requirements that leads to practical attacks of theoretically
secure system.</p>
