	  <p><h1>goals</h1>
         <p> By using cryptography many goals can be achieved....<br/>
1. Confidentiality: it is the most important goal, that ensures that nobody can understand the received message except the one who has the decipher key. <br/>
2. Authentication: it is the process of proving the identity, that assures the communicating entity is the one that it 
claimed to be. This means that the user or the system can prove their own identities to other parties who donâ€™t have 
personal knowledge of their identities.<br/>
3. Data Integrity: its ensures that the received message has not been changed in any way from its original form. The data may get modified by an unauthorized entity
 intentionally or accidently. Integrity service confirms that whether 
data is intact or not since it was last created, transmitted, or stored by an authorized user. This can be achieved by using hashing at both sides the sender and the
 recipient in order to create a unique message digest and compare it with 
the one that received.<br/>
4. Non-Repudiation: it is mechanism used to prove that the sender really sent this message, and the message was received by the specified party,
 so the recipient cannot claim that the message was not sent. For example, once an 
order is placed electronically, a purchaser cannot deny the purchase order, if non-repudiation service was enabled in this transaction.<br/>
5. Access Control: it is the process of preventing an unauthorized use of resources. This goal controls who can have access to the resources, If one can access, 
under which restrictions and conditions the access can be occurred.<br/></p>
	  <h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>Classical Cryptography is independent of the medium of transmission, and hence can be used to transmit highly sensitive data over long distances.<br/> 
Classical Cryptography is highly flexible and can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.<br/> 
Classical Cryptography does not require the use of computers or any such costly devices, and also classical cryptography does not require any 
special specification for the medium of transmission (courier), and thus considered as a cheap way of encryption of sensitive information.<br/> 
The one-time pad algorithm in classical cryptography is practically uncrackable.<br/> 
When used properly, classical cryptography protects your plain text from all sorts of casual snooping.<br/> 
<h2>Disadvantages</h2> <br/> 
The algorithms used in classical cryptography are not completely free from loopholes. As a result of such loopholes, the hackers can use it to crack the encrypted
 information and then use the same to perform all sorts of unethical activities.The key size used n classical cryptography is comparatively smaller. Resulting, reduces the life expectancy of the algorithms.Classical Cryptography is easier to implement, but it requires massive computation to make the algorithms effective.
The one-time pad is a cumbersome way of encrypting and requires a personal meeting for the exchange of the pads.<br/>
when using classical cryptography without the use of OTP, all individuals having proper knowledge in cryptography will be able to crack the
 code and extract all information<br/></p>
