 <p>Computers are used by millions of people for many purposes. such as banking, shopping, military, student records, 
etc.. Privacy is a critical issue in many of these applications, how are we need to make sure that an unauthorized parties cannot read or modify messages.
Cryptography is the transformation of readable and understandable data into a form which cannot be understood in 
order to secure data. cryptography refers exactly to the methodology of concealing the content of messages.<br/>
 the word 
cryptography comes from the Greek word "Kryptos", that means hidden, and "graphikos" which means writing.
The information that we need to hide, is called plaintext , Itâ€™s the original text, It could be in a form of characters, 
numerical data, executable programs, pictures, or any other kind of information, The plaintext for example is the 
sending of a message in the sender before encryption, or it is the text at the receiver after decryption.<br/>
The data that will be transmitted is called cipher text , it's a term refers to the string of "meaningless" data, or unclear 
text that nobody must understand, except the recipients. it is the data that will be transmitted Exactly through network, 
Many algorithms are used to transform plaintext into cipher text. <br/>
Cipher is the algorithm that is used to transform plaintext to cipher text, This method is called encryption, in other 
words, it's a mechanism of converting readable and understandable data into "meaningless" data.<br/>
The Key is an input to the encryption algorithm, and this value must be independent of the plaintext, This input is used 
to transform the plaintext into cipher text, so different keys will yield different cipher text, In the decipher side, the 
inverse of the key will be used inside the algorithm instead of the key.Computer security it's a generic term for a collection of tools designed to protect any data
 from hackers, theft, 
corruption, or natural disaster while allowing these data to be available to the users at the same time. The example of 
these tools is the antivirus program... Cryptography is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data.<br/>
Cryptography enables you to store sensitive information or transmit it across insecure networks (like the Internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except 
the intended recipient.so cryptography is the science of securing data, cryptanalysis is the science
of analyzing and breaking secure communication. Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning, application of
mathematical tools, pattern finding, patience, determination, and luck.Cryptanalysts are also called attackers.<br/>
Cryptology embraces both cryptography and cryptanalysis</p>
